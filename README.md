# Ukrainian victory faces
## Idea 
I strongly support my motherland, Ukaraine, in its struggle for freedom and independence during russian brutal invation.
I created convolutional neural image classifier, whitch recognizes faces of the most popular ukrainian heroes, such as President Zelensky.
## Data
Images collected from Google Images with Fatkun Chrome extension. After collection, images proccessed with OpevCV to setect and crop faces. Finally, manual data cleaning was made.
## Neural Net
I used basic convolutional image classification NN
